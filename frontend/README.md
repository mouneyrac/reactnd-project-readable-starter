This is my personal submission for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Redux course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).

The goal of this project is to create the ... app. See details in the Udacity course.

## Installation

npm install

npm start

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, Udacity provided a backend server for me to develop against.

## create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is a submission assignment for Udacity React nanodegree. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests (not like you want to do one anywau :P).
