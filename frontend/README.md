This is my personal submission for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Redux course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).

## Installation

npm install

npm start

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, Udacity provided a backend server for me to develop against. It can be found in ../api-server

## Contributing

This repository is a submission assignment for Udacity React nanodegree. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests (not like you want to do one anyway :P).
